# Interprocess-Communication

Overview

This project implements a communication service using the STOMP protocol. It consists of a server written in Java and a client written in C++. The server supports both Thread-Per-Client and Reactor models for handling multiple connections efficiently.

Features

STOMP Protocol Support: Implements STOMP for message exchange.

Multi-threading: Supports Thread-Per-Client and Reactor concurrency models.

Client-Server Architecture: Java-based server and C++ client.

User Authentication: Handles login and logout functionality.

Message Routing: Manages user subscriptions and message delivery.

Technologies Used
